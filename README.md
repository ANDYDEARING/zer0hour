# ZER0 HOUR #

Zero Hour is a top-down, round-based survival shooter built entirely with JavaScript and the [**Phaser**](phaser.io) game engine. 

The player, armed with a laser gun and a knife,  must hold off an onslaught of alien zombies while the surviving passengers of their severely damaged spaceship make their way to the escape pods. The survivors will drop off ammo and health for you to resupply; but as the player progresses through rounds, the zombies get stronger and faster, and ammo becomes more invaluable. 

### Controls ###

Zero Hour gives the player two different control styles to choose from:

__Modern__:
The modern control scheme gives the user the most control over aiming and shooting. It will immediately feel familiar to anyone who has played FPS games on the computer.

Movement:
+ Move up - `W`
+ Move down - `S`
+ Move left - `A`
+ Move right - `D`

Gameplay:
+ Aim with mouse
+ Shoot with left mouse button
+ Switch weapons with `E` or `SHIFT`
+ Pause with `ESC`

__Old-School__:
The old-school control scheme is reminiscent of a classic arcade game. It is much more simplified than the Modern controls, making it easier for users new to computer games or who prefer a classic experience.

Movement:
+ Arrow keys or WASD

Gameplay:
+ Shoot with `SPACEBAR`. The player will automaticaly shoot in the direction they are facing.
+ Switch weapons with `E` or `SHIFT`
+ Pause with `ESC`
